## Working Hours 🕙

Most of us start working around 10 am and leave somewhere between 6-8pm.
Some of us are early birds, begin at 8 am already and go home a bit earlier.
You have some freedom here to design your schedule. Just let your team know
about your plan and make sure they're ok with it.

* Need a little more sleep because you were burning the midnight oil?
   No big deal, just let your team know what’s up.
* Have a doctor’s appointment in the afternoon?
   No big deal, just let your team know what’s up.
* Need to leave early because you’re going to a concert?
   No big deal, just let your team know what's up and catch up on your working
   hours the previous or next day.
* You get the idea 🙂

## Holidays 🌴

### Scheduling your holidays

To allow your team to plan for your absence, please file your holiday requests **at least
four weeks before you’re going on vacation**. Now, if there’s a spontaneous thing happening
and you want to take a Friday off on short notice, then as long as your team’s goals are
not at risk, that's usually ok, too. Just try to give a heads up in due time, and we'll
figure it out together.

1. Log in to [Appogee Leave](https://leave.appogeehr.com/login) with your Google account
1. Make a new leave request
1. Your manager will now automatically get an email with your leave request
1. It never hurts to also informally give a heads up to your team
1. After receiving approval, your absence will automatically show up in our shared vacations
   calendar, so your team is aware
1. Happy Holiday 🏖😎☀️

P.S. If you put in a lot of overtime and feel like you deserve an extra vacation day,
please discuss with your manager. We'd like to think that we've always found a fair
solution so far.

### During your holidays

1. Email auto-responder: [Appogee Leave](https://leave.appogeehr.com)
   will automatically create one for you 🤙
2. Slack: Set your Slack status to *“on holiday 🌴”* or something

## When you’re sick 🤒

### When you’re a little sick-ish

When you’ve got a cold, but still want to work: Please don’t come into the office
and infect your co-workers. Take it slow, have a tea, stay home and work remotely.

### When you’re really, unpleasantly sick

Health comes first. Focus on getting better. Just be transparent about how long
it might take so we can plan. As much as we'd like to do this purely on a trust
basis, [for insurance reasons](https://www.juraforum.de/lexikon/lohnfortzahlungsversicherung)
we require a "sick certificate" ("Krankschreibung" in German) from your doctor
**from the 4th day of your absence**. So if you're sick Monday-Wednesday,
it's all good. If you're also sick on Thursday, we need the paperwork
for our insurance.

## The Tools We Use 🛠

* We use **GSuite** for email, calendars, drive, docs, spreadsheets, and slides.
* We use **Trello** to organize work.
* We use **Slack** for team messaging. To avoid Slack being too big of a distraction,
   we recommend turning off all notifications, except direct messages and mentions.
   It’s also okay to turn off Slack for a few hours if you need some focus time.
   Just make sure your team knows what’s up and when you’ll be back so they can plan around your schedule.
* We use **Zoom** for video chats.
* We use **GitLab** for managing our code.

## Security 🔒

As a financial services provider, **security is extremely important** to us. We're
handling millions of Dollars worth of transactions, so you need to act with
utmost care when it comes to security.

### Passwords

* Use 1password to manage all Brickblock-related passwords — no exceptions.
* ☝️ Don’t re-use a password. Always create a new one.
* Use of 1password’s password generator for creating safe passwords.

### 2-Factor-Authentication

* Use 2FA wherever possible, especially for your Google Account.
* We recommend [Authy](https://authy.com) to manage your 2FA tokens. Just make sure to
   [disable the multi-device functionality](https://bitsonline.com/authy-coinbase-multi-device-2fa/).

### Phishing Emails

* Email is NOT a secure medium. Always apply a healthy dose of skepticism to
   all emails that are asking you for internal information
* Only open email attachments when you’re 120% sure the sender is legit.
   Special care needs to be taken around `*.zip` or `*.exe`, `*.dmg`, or `*.vbs`
   files — they’re almost always malware or viruses
* When you receive a “strange” email from a co-worker, make sure to ask the person on Slack before following any links or opening attachments.
   Their account could be compromised, or the “FROM” field in the email is fake
* We've had cases where scammers where pretending to be our CEO to extract
   sensitive information from employees or wire money to scammer's accounts.

## Growth 💪

Your personal and professional growth is very important to us!

### One-on-Ones

You’ll have regular 30-60min one-on-one sessions with your manager to:

* Check in how you’re doing
* Give bi-directional feedback (your manager to you, and you to your manager)
* Discover and discuss opportunities for growth

### Learning New Skills

If you want to learn and grow your skill set, we'll support you in any way we can.
So if there are any courses/classes/seminars you want to take,
books you want to read, conferences you’d like to go to, or else:

Talk to us. Just explain to us how the company can also benefit from your learnings,
and we'll try to find a way to make it happen.

In case of physical or digital goods, just get written approval (Slack or Email is fine)
from your manager and then send an Amazon link to the Finance Team. They'll order it for
you.

### Using Your Growth Budget

If your contract includes an annual growth budget, here's how it works.

#### Get approval from your manager

You don't have to fill out any annoying forms. Just get a quick written
approval from your manager. Can be via email or even slack. E.g.:

> **You**: Hey Boss ✌️<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;there's a very interesting course about XYZ on udemy.com<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Would love to do it as part of my growth budget. Is that ok?
>
> **Boss**: Sure! Approved 🙂

#### Buy It

**IMPORTANT: You will need an invoice that is addressed to Brickblock**

Two options:

1. Pay by yourself and reimburse later 💵

   If it's urgent, or some Black Friday deal is running out:
   You can always pay with your personal credit card, and we'll reimburse you later.

1. Pay with a company credit card 💳

   Reach out to our finance team with the written approval from your manager
   and ask them to pay it for you. If you ask nicely, they'll usually do it
   on the same day 🙏.

#### Send us the invoice

It's critical that you always get an invoice in the name of the company.
Otherwise, we won't be able to reimburse you!

The correct billing address is:

>Brickblock Digital Services GmbH<br>
>Ohlauer Straße 43<br>
>10999 Berlin<br>
>USt. ID (VAT ID): Ask our finance team for this information

## Fitness 🏃‍♀️

Your physical and mental health are very important to us.

We will pay up to €44 per month towards your fitness expenses. That can be your 
monthly gym membership or yoga studio fee, a [headspace](https://www.headspace.com)
subscription, or the race registration fee for that half marathon you're training for.

Why exactly €44? Because it's the
[legal limit in Germany for tax-free bonuses](https://www.edenred.de/steuerfreier-sachbezug/).
Every Euro above would incur taxes and social security costs for both you and us.

### How to reimburse

Every employee receives a [Givve MasterCard](https://www.givve.com). You will get 44€ topped up on your card every month and will be able to spend it towards all
physical or mental health-related expenses. It works just like a regular Mastercard, except that you can’t get money out from the ATM. 

1. Get written approval from your manager for your expense
   (informal slack approval is enough)
1. Use your Givve card to pay your expense
1. Send the receipt to our finance team along with the written
   approval from your manager

## Expenses 💵

We trust you to spend money wisely. It’s simple: Are you acting
in the best interest of the company? If yes, then it’s pretty likely that you’ll get
your expenses approved.

So if you’re booking a flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye;
buy the direct connection as long as it's reasonably priced.

If you’re attending a conference on behalf of Brickblock and want to invite some
business partners, sure, Brickblock will buy your meals.
Just don’t buy caviar and champagne for everyone ❌🍾❌. **Due to German tax
legislation, we can not reimburse your private meals, only meals with business partners.**

Try to limit conference travel to once a year, and if you want to extend your hotel
stay for personal reasons: That’s cool, but please pay the extra nights yourself
🙂.  Unless there are important events before or after the conference (meetings,
networking events), that’s OK of course.

**If you have questions about what “spend it wisely” means, just ask!**

### Getting Approval

Expenses need to be approved by your manager. For small things (office supplies,
cables, USB sticks...), a simple slack message asking for approval is sufficient.
For more substantial expenses (new laptop, expensive conference ticket, etc.), please
email your manager.

### Receipts / Invoices

Always make sure to get a written invoice with our official company address
as the recipient:

>Brickblock Digital Services GmbH<br>
>Ohlauer Straße 43<br>
>10999 Berlin<br>
>VAT ID: DE317623147

### Reimbursement

We reimburse expenses quarterly. Please make sure to send all expense reports and
invoices to our finance team (cc your manager) before the end
of the quarter. If you had a large expense and can’t wait until the end
of the quarter to be reimbursed: talk to us.

### Company Credit cards

We have [Pleo credit cards](https://www.pleo.io) for senior-level employees.
Not everyone will get one but if you do, here’s how it works:

- You have one virtual and one plastic card; both are Prepaid MasterCards.
- With the Pleo app for your smartphone, you'll get real-time purchase notifications
   and you can scan receipts on-the-go.

#### What you have to do:

1. [Watch this Video 👀](https://pleo-1.wistia.com/medias/0ue4gsv69e) to understand how it
works.
1. Check out [this presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W0KRHisOkJL2PcYiJo49wWPMG5JlaTv-/view)
   that explains what and how you can make use of the cards here
1. Always upload the invoices or receipts - it’s super easy to add them to your app or on
   your desktop. Pleo will ping you to add the receipt, so you won’t forget to do it ;)

#### Limits

Management will set the limits per employee. It entirely depends on your role.
If you're a Business Developer that's traveling a lot, then you'll need a higher limit
than somebody that spends most of their time in the office or working remotely.
Just talk to your manager to figure out the right limit for you.

#### Pleo Expense Policy

We compiled a list of things that you can use your card for.
If you need something that's not listed here, just ask your manager or the finance
team and we'll figure it out.

Here's what's explicitly approved:

##### Digital Card

Digital services or recurring fees. Typically this will be services for the company such
as GSuite, Trello, or Slack; or software licenses such as Adobe Creative Cloud,
WebStorm, etc.

##### Plastic Card

- Meals with business partners or team meals when approved or paid for by the respective team
   lead.
    - Please always write down *with who* you were dining and what *the reason* for it was.
       We need this information for our tax advisor.
- Business trips
    - Flights to and from the destination, train tickets, bus tickets or taxi 
      receipts at the destination
    - Hotel or Airbnb at the destination
        - Please try to book it _without_ breakfast. If there's breakfast listed on
          the invoice, [it will get more complicated](https://www.reisekosten.de/kuerzung-der-verpflegungspauschale-regel-und-sonderfaelle/)
          to calculate and pay your "[Verpflegungspauschale](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verpflegungsmehraufwand)"
- Transportation to and from business meetings
    - Please take public transport if available and reasonably fast. Taxi or
       Ride-sharing in all other cases is ok as well.

## Need Hardware? 🖥

If you need specific hardware for your work and it isn’t ridiculously expensive,
we’ll always try to make it happen. Please write an email to your manager that
answers the following questions:

### What do you need?

MacBook Pro 13''<br>
CPU: 3.5GHz<br>
RAM: 16GB<br>
SSD: 256GB<br>
Link: https://www.apple.com/de/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MPXV2D/A&step=config

### How much does it cost?

€2.599

### Why do you need it?

Need the extra CPU because for developing, I need to run many CPU-intensive processes
(e.g., Tests, Docker, Virtual Machines, Web servers, etc.)

Need the extra RAM because for developing, I need to run many processes in parallel
(e.g., Frontend Server, Backend Server, Database, Ethereum Node, Browser in Development
Mode)
